<strong class="miss">New features</strong>
<br /><strong class="miss">New animal textures</strong>
<br />- In this update, the developers are trying to involve mobs and biomes, which you are already familiar with, to elaborate and improve these locations in the game world.
<br />- Cows. The game will offer 2 new looks for cows; from now on, their colors will directly depend on the biome they are in. For example, temperate cows are the standard ones featuring a vanilla texture, while snowy cows will spawn in the cold biomes of the game – in taiga and others; the tropical ones – in savannah, jungle, and other warm biomes.
<br />- Hens. The developers have also added a few colors to all the hens in the game, with their textures depending on the biomes. The snowy ones will be in the corresponding locations, the tropical ones in jungle, wastelands, and savannah. Each of the species has its specific egg type; the player can use them both for crafting and for summoning chickens, with their texture no longer being depend on the biome they were hatched in.
<br />- Pigs. At last, the game has got more options for pigs, whose look can also vary depending on the biomes. Everything is just the same with pigs – there are snowy and tropical versions.
<br />- Wolves. These animals will get 6 additional sound options, for example, angry, sad, and so on. It’s nice to hear different kinds of sounds from wolves, especially at night. Well, new textures for wolves are available in the game as well.
<br /><strong class="miss">New Blocks</strong>
<br />- A new type of vegetation will appear in the game – bushes. They can be generated in plains, hills, near rivers, and in forests. The player can collect them with scissors or a tool enchanted with the «Silk touch» effect. The bush is also used for composting.
<br />- Bushes with fireflies. Another vegetation type, which is mainly generated in swamps and near rivers. At night, they emit particles of fireflies, at the same time making certain sounds during this period. You can throw bushes into a composter, using bone meal for rapid growth.
<br />- Low and high dry grass. Several types of dry grass have appeared in Minecraft, which is generated mainly in deserts and wastelands. This is a kind of update prepared for these biomes to breathe life and somehow diversify these locations. They are 1 block high and can be used in a composter. Sheep also eat these kinds of vegetation.
<br />- Dry leaves. There is another major update in the game that will significantly change the atmosphere in the biomes, especially in the forest ones. From now on, the players will see dry leaves under their feet, which you can make both naturally and by burning the foliage in an oven. Moreover, you can use them as fuel in the future.
<br />- Field flowers. You will find new types of flowers in the game world, mainly in meadows and birch forests. One block may contain up to four flowers. They look very beautiful and unusual. You can use them to craft a yellow dye.
<br />- Cactus flower. Now, some of the cacti in the desert will be generated with flowers at the top. You can use these flowers to craft pink dye. You don’t need any tool to craft them. A cactus flower can be placed on any block.

<br />- Mushroom cow has been slightly changed;
<br />- Cartographer sells 7 different types of maps in the village;
<br />- The sheep color will largely depend on the biome which they spawn in;
<br />- Tagged Creaking doesn’t disappear at daytime and can be summoned using its tag;

							<div class="news_desc">
							<span class="news_lil">Release date: December 3, 2024.</span>
							<p>
<strong class="miss">Blocks</strong>
<br />- Pale Moss Carpet. It can grow up to two blocks high and spread to adjacent full-blown blocks. It can be fertilized with the bone meal, which will allow the moss to spread to all sides of neighboring blocks.

						<!-- <div style="margin-top:5px"></div><div style="margin-left:2px"><div class="ramka2" id='ad-banner'></div></div> -->


							 
- Pale Moss Block. It is a themed block that can be used in construction. When fertilized with the bone meal, it can also spread to neighboring blocks.
<br />- Eyeblossom. Its natural variant can generate in the pale garden biome. This flower can be closed or open and has a glowing eye. It can be used to cook the suspicious stew or to poison bees.
<br />- Pale Block Planks. They are a new material that can be used both for building and crafting other blocks such as doors, steps, etc. It is distinguished by its pale color.
<br />- Pale Oak Log. It is a generated material suitable for processing and obtaining the above planks. It can be stripped as well.
<br />- Resin Clump. It is a new block generated near creaking hearts and placeable on any full-blown block. It is used for crafting resin bricks and resin blocks.
<br />- Pale Oak Leaves. They are a new type of foliage peculiar to pale oaks.
<br />- Pale Oak Sapling. It is a new sapling used to grow pale oaks (you will need 2x2 blocks). It can be planted in a flower pot.
<br />- Pale Hanging Moss. It is an additional eye-pleasing element of the pale oak's crown. It hangs like a vine and can make a terrible noise.
<br />- Creaking Heart. It is a versatile block that appears in the pale garden biome and can be found inside an oak tree. It sends particles to the creaker, generates resin clumps, and can be destroyed with an axe. It can make a terrible noise and can be crafted according to the following recipe: one block of resin and two pale oak logs.
<br />- Block of Resin. It can be created from nine resin clumps.
<br />- Resin Brick Block. It can be created from four resin bricks.
<br /><strong class="miss">Items</strong>
<br />- The new version could not bus add a new mob. However, it is only one:
<br />- The creaking is an aggressive mob that spawns near creaking hearts. It can deal three damage points, is highly fire-resistant, can ignore obstacles, including berry bushes, cacti, and loose snow, and is incapable of boarding a boat or entering a portal. If you summon it using the egg, the creaking will have one health point.
<br />- As for the entity, the update adds one option:
<br />- Pale Oak Boat. It is a transport means that has a cargo variant.
<br />- Pale Garden is a new pale-colored biome where all the new content is generated. It can be considered a variant of Dark Forest and is without music tracks. It is noteworthy that this biome is generated as adjacent to the Dark Forest: it is there that you will be able to find it.
<br />- The pale oak is a new tree of pale color with a white crown.
<br /><strong class="miss">Changes</strong>
<br />- Even though the changes do not add new content, they are still noteworthy. We have listed the most significant changes noticeable in the game world.
<br /><strong class="miss">Mobs</strong>
<br />- The effects applied to bees have been changed. If you decide to feed a bee with an eyeblossom or a wither rose, it will lose the ability to reproduce and may be subjected to desiccation or poisoning. If the eyeblossom is closed, the bee cannot poisoned by it and does not show any attention to it.
<br />- The mobs' preference as regards items on the ground have been changed. They will now judge according to priorities and will pick up items that are better in terms of durability, enchantments, quality, etc.
<br />- The breeding of wolves and cats now results in a new collar color. The latter is now a mixture of the color of the parents' collars.
<br />- Pillagers and piglins now prefer picking up crossbows to picking up other weapons.
<br />- Strays, bogged, and skeletons will now try to get a bow.
<br />- The drowned now prefer tridents.

							<div class="news_desc">
							<span class="news_lil">Release date: October 23, 2024.</span>
							<p>
							
<strong class="miss">Bug Fixes</strong>
<br />- The player may experience an error when connecting to a realm with a resource pack enabled. Update 1.21.3 successfully fixes this bug.
<br />- When you launched the game world after updating to the 1.21.2 version, salmons from version 1.21.1 and earlier became small.

							</div>
							<div class="news_desc">
							<span class="news_lil">Release date: October 22, 2024.</span>
							<p>
							
<strong class="miss">New Content</strong>
<br />- The update adds babies for the following mobs: the dolphin, squid, glow squid, and salmon. The new variants have been added to obtain parity with Bedrock Edition.
<br /><strong class="miss">Bundle</strong>
<br />- The main innovation of update 1.21.2 is special bundles for storing resources. The player can create this item themselves using a thread and leather in the crafting table. Despite its not particularly impressive capacity, the bundle can be useful for carrying various resources so that they do not take up space in the inventory. That is especially convenient if you carry individual items only. A bundle can be dyed in 16 colors. After dying, it cannot be washed in a cauldron.
<br />- The capacity of the new bundles is not that large: 64 items or blocks. The player can put either 64 different individual items or a 64x stack of some resource in it. If you put a bundle in a bundle, it will take up four cells, and if it is full, this will also be taken into account. However, you will not be able to put a shulker box in a bundle, even if it is empty.
<br />- Putting resources in a bundle is very simple: it is enough to open the inventory, take the desired item, hover over the bundle, and click the LMB.
<br /><strong class="miss">Banner Patterns</strong>
<br />- The update adds two new banner patterns: bordure intented and field masoned. They were previously available in Bedrock Edition only.
<br /><strong class="miss">Experimental Content</strong>
<br />- When generating a new world, you will see the Experiments section. At the moment, it contains four options related to the upcoming update: Minecart Improvements, Redstone Experiments, Villager Trade Rebalance, and Winter Drop. The latter category is the most interesting, as it contains the main innovations of the major update, which, most likely, will be released in the winter — although that is just a suggestion.
<br /><strong class="miss">Minecart Improvements</strong>
<br />- This content is aimed at making minecart rides more comfortable and, most importantly, fascinating. The developers have changed many parameters of this vehicle. They are available in the settings but are disabled by default. These settings add a special feature that makes the player sitting in a minecart rotate along with it.
<br /><strong class="miss">Redstone Experiments</strong>
<br />- This category of the experimental content is related to the redstone. Its effectiveness has been improved, and the block update principle has been updated. The main goal was the same efficiency of a redstone wire regardless of position and orientation.
<br />- The redstone signal will update all blocks capable of receiving it. Even though there is not much information about this category for now, in the major update, the developers will certainly refine many other functions so that redstone circuits are even more efficient and useful.
<br /><strong class="miss">Villager Trade Rebalance</strong>
<br />- Thanks to this rebalance, trading with villagers will become a highly profitable activity, as you will not have to spend several emeralds to get sticks anymore. The exchange will be more equivalent, and the villagers will be able to offer the player very profitable deals, which will be certainly hard to resist.
<br /><strong class="miss">Winter Drop</strong>
<br />- However, the most interesting thing for players is perhaps the new content. With the release of major updates, the game becomes more diverse, and the abundance of innovations never ceases to amaze. Thus, the next major update will add new locations to explore, building blocks, creatures, etc., to the game. At the moment, some of the new options are already available, and you can activate them when creating a new world.
<br />- A new biome generated in the game world is called Pale Garden. It is a forest biome consisting of a new type of tree. The color of the soil there differs from other locations and corresponds to the color of the new trees. You will find the pale oak there, which resembles the dark oak in terms of structure — they differ only in color and bark texture.
<br />- Besides the new tree, the blocks of pale moss are generated in that biome, and you can see moss hanging from the foliage as well. The standard set of blocks can be crafted from the pale oak: planks, doors, boats, signs, and more.
<br />- The update adds a new mob called Creaking. It was created specifically for the new biome because its texture resembles that of pale oak. It entirely consists of the bark of that tree as well as moss hanging on it. Even though it is aggressive, it is not difficult to defeat.
<br />- If you summon this mob using a spawn egg, it will not have its natural properties, but you will still be able to learn something about it. Thus, if you look at the creaking, it will not attack you, but if you turn away from it, this creature will deal damage. However, the mob summoned using the egg has only one health point, so it will be easy to kill it.
<br />- But that is not the most interesting thing! The new creature can also appear in the game world in a different way, and then it becomes much more dangerous. Being in the dark in the pale garden, you can hear frightening sounds, which indicate that a creaking is already preparing to spawn.
<br />- Somewhere in the oaks, you will find a new block called the creaking heart. It is to this block that the creaker is tied, and thanks to it it spawns. It is not easy to find this block, as it is hidden somewhere in the bark of a tree and externally disguised by logs. The creaker itself is invincible, and you will not be able to kill it by just hitting it with something. However, if you try to hit it, you will see special particles that can lead you to a pale oak tree with a hidden block inside. Your task is to destroy this block as soon as possible so that the creaker disappears.

<strong class="miss">New Languages</strong>
<br />- This minor update brings several new languages at once: Belarusian (Latin). It is just an addition to the traditional Cyrillic variant. Tzotzil, it is a little-spoken language of a Maya people who live in the Mexican state of Chiapas.
<br /><strong class="miss">Fixes</strong>
<br />- The update suppression based on block entity swap has been fixed.
<br />- Previously, players could artificially cause an emergency shutdown of a server by misusing special commands for a malicious target selector input, but now, they will not be able to do that thanks to the hotfix.

<strong class="miss">New Blocks</strong>
<br /><strong>Chiseled bookshelf</strong>
<br />- It is a new type of bookshelf that can store both regular and enchanted books. This block does not have an interface, and you can take books or put them in this block by clicking on the right mouse button. The chiseled bookshelf can store up to six books.
<br /><strong>Bamboo Planks</strong>
<br />- Bamboo planks can be used as a building block or to create fences, slabs, doors, pressure plates, and other blocks. They are made from bamboo. They can also be used to get a new bamboo mosaic block.
<br /><strong>Bamboo Mosaic</strong>
<br />- It is a building block that can be used in construction, as well as to create stairs and slabs.
<br /><strong>Hanging Sign</strong>
<br />- You can leave inscriptions on this block and use it, for example, as a street nameplate. The hanging sign is crafted with logs and chains. The appearance of the hanging sign depends on the logs used in crafting.
<br /><strong>Ancient Plant</strong>
<br />- It is a new plant that can be obtained by planting ancient seeds.
<br /><strong>Sniffer Egg</strong>
<br />It is a fairly valuable block you can find in Ocean Ruins, more specifically from chests there. You can use this egg to hatch a new creature – a sniffer.
<br /><strong class="miss">New Items</strong>
<br /><strong>Ancient Seeds</strong>
<br />- You cannot find them on your own, only with the help of a sniffer. This creature digs up the ground to bring you ancient seeds. By planting such a seed, you can get a new plant.
<br /><strong class="miss">New Mobs</strong>
<br /><strong>Sniffer</strong>
<br />- This mob enters the game since it is the winner of Minecraft Live Mob Vote 2022. The sniffer hatches from sniffer eggs. It will dig up the ground in search of ancient seeds so that you can plant them and grow new types of plants.
<br /><strong>Camel</strong>
<br />- It is a new creature that you can ride to travel the world. You can get a baby camel by feeding adult camels with a cactus. It moves faster than any other creature along rivers and ravines. Unlike a horse, a camel can carry up to two players. 		
<strong class="miss">New Features</strong>
<br />- The bulk of an update is almost always content. So, first of all, feel free to study it to understand what to expect from the major update..
<br /><strong class="miss">New Blocks</strong>
<br />- Blocks make up the bulk of the content in survival. So, let’s look at them closer and study the list of items one can craft from new blocks..
<br />- Chiseled copper is the first important block generated in the Trial Chambers. You can also use the stonecutter or crafting table to craft it. For the crafting table, you need two cut copper slabs. If you choose the stonecutter, you will need one block of regular copper, which will turn into four chiseled copper after processing.
<br />- You can get chiseled tuff by crafting (use 2 tuff slabs) or using the stonecutter to cut regular tuff. This block appears in the Trial Chambers.
<br />- The bulb serves as a light source that can be subject to oxidation. The stronger it is, the dimmer the light, so do not forget to scrape the bulb with an axe or honeycomb to prevent its oxidation. The bulb is off by default, but you can use Redstone to turn it on. It can serve as a trigger and doesn’t conduct Redstone energy.
<br />- The copper door is a building block made from improved copper. You can find it in the Trial Chambers or craft using the following crafting method:
<br />- You can use it as a functional door and open it with Redstone or by right-clicking. The copper door is subject to oxidation, which you can prevent by scraping it with a honeycomb or an axe. The door’s durability reduces with increasing oxidation.
<br />- The copper grate is a universal building block you can stumble upon in the Trial Chambers. Despite being transparent, it can block the passage of mobs and water. In addition, it lets light in. The grate doesn’t conduct Redstone energy and cannot be used to choke enemies that fall into it. One can craft it using the crafting table or the stonecutter:
<br />- The copper trapdoor is a building block that appears in the Trial Chambers. It can serve as a functional element if you use Redstone to open it. To create it, you need to use:
<br />- It is subject to oxidation, so do not forget to scrape it with a honeycomb or an axe.
<br />- The heavy core is a block of epic rarity and high density. Combined with a breeze rod, it can serve as a mace. It has a size identical to the main character’s head and can have 12 directions. To obtain the heavy core, find an ominous vault and activate it with a key in the Trial Chambers. It is resistant to explosions (identical to obsidian in characteristics).
<br />- Tuff bricks are a building material extracted with the stonecutter when processing polished tuff. You can use it to build stairs, walls, and slabs.
<br />- The tuff slab is a building material obtained by the stonecutter when working with tuff. You can use it to create objects or chiseled tuff.
<br />- Tuff stairs are a building material obtained by the stonecutter during the processing of tuff.
<br />- The tuff wall is a building material obtained by the stonecutter during the processing of tuff.
<br />- The vault is a unique block unlocked by trial keys only once per player. The reward is randomly generated and given out in random quantities. It is highly resistant to explosions and doesn’t burn.
<br />- Players can test their strength thanks to the following new block – the ominous trial spawner. This block works as the regular trial spawner generated in the Trial Chambers. The newly added version differs only in that the mobs in the ominous version will be much more dangerous. Respectively, you receive more valuable rewards. The most precious thing you can get is the ominous trial key with a 30% chance to eject. The ominous trial spawner won’t appear naturally. For it to appear in the structure, you must have the Trial Omen effect.
<br />- The update adds a new ominous vault, which appears in hard-to-reach places of the structure. The ominous vault differs not only in texture but also in its resources. The vault can drop many valuable resources, including new items added by this update. You will need a slightly different item to open the vault – the ominous trial key.
