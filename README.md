# PortableTL
Wanna play Minecraft in school? No worries! Follow these instructions and you're good to go!

## Directions of use
Let me begin by saying IF you get caught, my name should never be mentioned. NEVER.
Now, it's very simple to install PortableTL.

1. Download the latest release or the source code.
2. Extract it into a folder, preferably one where its quiet and secretive.
3. Run the run.bat file.
4. IF the system asks for public / private network access stuff, just click cancel.

Note: This is only available for windows, and I don't plan on extending it to Mac or Linux (as of now).
